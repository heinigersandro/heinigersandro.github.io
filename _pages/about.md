I am a highly motivated 5th year PhD candidate specializing in 'Econometrics' at the University of St. Gallen, under the supervision of Michael Lechner. With a projected completion date of my dissertation of summer 2023, I am actively seeking Assistant Professor or PostDoc positions for the fall of 2023.

My research is primarily focused on developing and advancing causal analysis estimation methods, specifically in the realm of causal machine learning.  I am also dedicated to applying cutting-edge data analysis and causal estimation techniques to a wide range of domains in social and human sciences. By combining my expertise in quantitative research with my passion for exploring research questions that delve into the internal and external factors that affect human decision-making and interactions, I aim at uncovering insights into social behavior that have far-reaching implications.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in 'Computational Science and Engineering' from ETH Zurich, followed by a Master's degree in 'Statistics' from the University of Neuchatel. My diverse academic background has given me a unique perspective and skillset that has proven valuable in my current research pursuits.
