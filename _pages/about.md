I am an econometrician, computational scientist, and educator with a strong academic foundation built during my studies at ETH Zurich, the University of Neuch√¢tel, and the University of St. Gallen. My journey has equipped me with a multidisciplinary skill set that spans computational science, advanced statistical analysis, and practical applications in data-driven fields.

My work bridges methodological and applied research. On the methodological side, I have created and enhanced causal estimators, including a modified matrix completion approach with integrated model selection properties, which I implemented as an open-source R package. On the applied side, my research is driven by an enthusiasm for leveraging state-of-the-art data analysis and causal inference methodologies to address pressing questions in the social and human sciences, delivering actionable insights that make an impact.

As a lecturer at the University of St. Gallen, I teach master's-level courses on Big Data Analytics, helping students navigate large datasets and master data engineering pipelines, from data generation to visualization. My professional background includes extensive experience in the private sector, where I honed my expertise in enterprise-level data workflows, and entrepreneurial ventures, including leading a start-up project.

With a blend of academic excellence, private sector experience, and entrepreneurial endeavors, I bring a unique perspective to leading data science and data engineering initiatives. My goal is to generate actionable insights, drive decision-making, and contribute meaningfully to projects that have a lasting impact across industries and disciplines.
