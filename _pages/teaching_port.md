I hold several teaching experiences at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Already as a student at ETH, I have started to teach exercise sessions which have always been a great pleasure. 
In the course of my research assistant position at the SEW-HSG, I have assisted numerous courses and supervised bachelor's and master's theses. Amongst others, the effected teaching assistances cover Predicitive Econometrics courses at graduate level and Statistical Programming at undergraduate level.

A full list of teaching assistances and supervisions can be consulted in the [<a href="../files/github_Teaching_Portfolio.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teaching Portfolio</a> ]

I value teaching as an integral part of an academic position and am commited to promoting and mentoring young academics.
