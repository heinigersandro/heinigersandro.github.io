I have gained extensive experience in teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses. During my time as a student at ETH, I began teaching exercise sessions and found them to be very rewarding. As a research assistant at SEW-HSG, I have assisted with various courses and provided supervision for numerous bachelor's and master's theses. My teaching experience includes courses such as Predictive Econometrics at the graduate level and Statistical Programming at the undergraduate level.

In addition to promoting and mentoring young academics, I believe that teaching is also an opportunity for me to continue learning and improving my own skills as a researcher and educator. I strive to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for all of my students, and I am always seeking new ways to engage them and facilitate their understanding of complex topics. Whether through incorporating real-world examples, encouraging class discussions, or utilizing innovative teaching technologies, I am committed to providing a high-quality educational experience for all of my students.
