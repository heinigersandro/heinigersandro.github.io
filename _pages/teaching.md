I have developed extensive experience teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in Econometrics, Statistics, and Economics. My teaching journey began during my studies at ETH, where I led exercise sessions — a role I found highly rewarding. As a research assistant at SEW-HSG, I contributed to various courses and supervised numerous bachelor’s and master’s theses. Currently, I serve as a lecturer for the graduate course *Big Data Analytics* at the University of St. Gallen and *Introduction to Econometrics* at UniDistance.

In addition to promoting and mentoring young academics, I view teaching as an opportunity to continue learning and enhancing my own skills as a researcher and educator. I strive to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for all my students, actively seeking innovative ways
to engage them and facilitate their understanding of complex topics. Whether through incorporating real-world examples, encouraging class discussions, or leveraging cutting-edge teaching technologies, I am committed to delivering a high-quality educational experience. These principles guide my teaching philosophy and reflect my dedication to fostering academic growth and curiosity among my students.
